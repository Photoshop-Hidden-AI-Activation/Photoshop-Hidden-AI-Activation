This document maps **Photoshop’s hidden and semi-hidden AI capabilities**:  
Generative Fill, AI Remove, Smart Expand, Neural Filters, selection-models,  
and vision-powered automation layers.

No cracks, no license bypassing —  
all features described are official Photoshop AI systems.

##  — AI System Identification Header  
**Subsystem:** Adobe Photoshop AI / VisionML / Firefly Models  
**Activation Method:** Tool Trigger + Internal Model Load  
**Visibility:** Semi-Hidden / Operator Level  
**AI Domains:** Generative • Vision • Segmentation • Replacement • Expansion

Photoshop contains multiple embedded AI engines that activate silently  
when certain tools or workflows are triggered.

---

##  — Surface-Level AI Features  
The visible AI tools include:

- **Generative Fill (Beta/Stable)**  
- **Generative Expand**  
- **AI Remove Tool**  
- **Object Aware Selections**  
- **Smart Background Replacement**  
- **Live Object Recognition (Hover Detect)**  
- **Neural Filters (local + cloud)**

These tools appear simple, but operate on deep internal AI pipelines.

##  — Subsurface AI Architecture  
Photoshop uses several internal ML components:

### • VisionSegmenter  
Detects objects, people, regions, depth layers.

### • StructuralML  
Understands perspective, shapes, scene layout.

### • Firefly Model Core  
Handles generative content: fill, expand, replace.

### • NeuralFiltersEngine  
Applies style transfer, face-aware edits, colorization.

### • EdgePredict Model  
Predicts missing pixels and smooths transitions.

### • ContentGraph Engine  
Represents relationships between scene elements.

All these engines activate on-demand when needed.

---

##  — Activation Chain (One Action → Multiple AI Modules)  
Photoshop can trigger **several AI systems at once**.

Example activation sequence:

###  — Region Detection  
VisionSegmenter identifies objects + boundaries.

###  — Context Graph Build  
Scene relationships and depth logic load.

###  — AI Input Processing  
Firefly prepares masked input + metadata.

###  — Generative Fill / Remove / Expand  
Generative model executes edit.

###  — Smart Post-Processing  
EdgePredict refines and cleans transitions.

This creates the illusion of “one click”,  
but actually activates **5+ internal AI subsystems**.

---

##  — Hidden AI Behaviours  
Photoshop has several AI behaviours **not shown in the UI**:

### • “Hover Selection AI”  
Object detection happens constantly in preview mode.

### • “Adaptive Mask Refinement”  
AI adjusts your mask edge automatically after selection.

### • “Context-Aware Prompt Influence”  
Even if no prompt is typed, Fill uses scene metadata.

### • “Depth Guessing Layer”  
AI infers depth to blend fills more naturally.

### • “Semantic Cleanup Pass”  
AI removes visual artifacts after generation.

These subsystems are active but invisible.
